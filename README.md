# MORTR

## Disclamer
This is in no way a finnished product, and it probably never will be.  
It is just something I am making in my spare time for fun, and to learn a thing or two.  

## Examples
To run the examples you either tun the `mortr` binary from the root directory from the project, or you do `cargo run`.  
To select an example, you just add the path to it after running the binary like this:
```console
mortr ./examples/main.mortr
``` 
or you do the same but with the cargo command like this:
```console
cargo run -- ./examples/main.mortr
```
